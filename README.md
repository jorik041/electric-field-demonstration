# electric-field-demonstration

This is an old one. nothing fancy really. 

It was just meant to be a university project which now I'm sharing it's source. so don't expect much of it.
It just shows something and if you think anything is wrong just make your PRs and I may never check 'em ;)

To build it you need Unity3D application installed on your machine. and just hit compile and cross your fingers!
